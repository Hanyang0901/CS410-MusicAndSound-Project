# Project: Spectrum Analyzer

To keep things simple, I used as least libraries as possible - except for necessary libs, only pyqtgraph is used to replace the slow matplotlib functions.

## All packages used:
numpy
scipy
pyaudio
pyqtgraph

## Python version:
Python 3.7 (Pycharm 2020.1)

For better understanding, I saved my first code as spectrum_analyzer_basic.py as a basic implementation template.

## spectrum_analyzer_basic.py

This is a basic version of Audio Spectrum Analyzer based on PyQtGraph.
Just basic FFT and spectrum auto scaling.

## spectrum_analyzer_advanced.py

This is an advanced version of Audio Spectrum Analyzer based on PyQtGraph.
Spectrum is in dB with log scaling.
